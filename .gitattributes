# Asset Management for Children of the Singularity
#
# Assets are now managed via AWS S3 instead of Git LFS to avoid bandwidth limits.
# Use the following commands to manage assets:
#
# Upload assets to S3:
#   ./scripts/s3-manager.sh upload-assets assets/ latest-assets/
#
# Download assets from S3:
#   ./scripts/s3-manager.sh download-assets latest-assets/ assets/
#
# The build process automatically downloads assets from S3 before building.
# See documentation/s3-integration-guide.md for detailed setup.

# Text files should use LF line endings (no LFS needed)
