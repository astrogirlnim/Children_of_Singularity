## 🎨 Visual Style (Moebius-inspired)

| Element         | Style                      |
|-----------------|----------------------------|
| Palette         | Soft pastels + muted neons  |
| Shapes          | Cluttered, organic-mechanical |
| Linework        | Clean but worn, imperfect   |
| Spacefields     | Busy, layered, surreal      |
| UI              | Brutalist, cold bureaucracy |

## 🌈 Color Rules
- Backgrounds: Desaturated greys, faded blues.
- Objects: Muted primaries, soft highlight glows.
- UI: Cold neutrals, occasional glitch neon for AI prompts.

---

## 🖌️ Texture & Detail
- Flat colors with light grain.
- Subtle vignette edges.
- Layers of debris create depth through contrast, not heavy shading.

---

## 🔊 Audio Style
- Ambient synths, soft glitch.
- AI: Polite, eerie TTS voices.
- SFX: Static, mechanical hums, broken signals.

---

## 🎭 Mood Consistency
- Corporate calm masking AI menace.
- Friendly tone with undercurrent of decay.
- Sparse, lonely, but absurdly bureaucratic.
