## UI / UX Principles for Children of the Singularity

### üìê Core Principles

1. **Clarity Over Complexity**  
   Navigation, collection, trading, and upgrading must be clear at all times. Avoid clutter, favor simplicity.

2. **Player Feedback First**  
   UI must reinforce actions with clear visual/audio cues: collection progress, inventory updates, AI communications.

3. **Atmosphere Supports Function**  
   UI design complements the Moebius-inspired, wacky dystopian world‚ÄîUI elements should not break immersion but reflect the universe's decayed, bureaucratic tone.

4. **Minimal Dependency Between Systems**  
   UI components (HUD, Inventory, Map, Trading) should operate independently to reduce coupling and support modular development.

## üñ•Ô∏è UI Patterns & Components

### HUD
- Minimalist indicators: inventory slots, credits, upgrade status.
- Persistent radar / mini-map in corners.
- AI broadcast overlay appears as intrusive but polite pop-up.

### Inventory
- Grid-based with rarity / type color coding.
- Max capacity clearly indicated.

### Trading / Upgrading
- Simple transactional screens with clear "sell / buy" feedback.
- Upgrade categories: Ship, Tools, AI Augments.

### AI Communications
- Overlay voice subtitles.
- Optional log history accessible via tab.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Conventions
- Godot 4.x `Control` nodes hierarchy.
- Use Signals to decouple UI updates from gameplay logic.
- Avoid complex animations‚Äîfavor slight UI distortions, flickers in line with the corporate/AI tone.
