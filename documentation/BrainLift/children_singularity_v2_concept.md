# **Children of the Singularity - Phased Roadmap (Concept V2)**

---

## **Phase 1: Core MVP (Essential for G2P3 Pass)**

**Goal:** Deliver the full playable loop in line with G2P3 success criteria: multiplayer, performance, progression, fun factor.

### Core Features:

- ✅ Small Multiplayer Zones (single shared room for MVP)
- ✅ Trash Collection Loop (navigate > collect)
- ✅ Trading at NPC Hub (sell for credits)
- ✅ Simple Upgrades (speed, capacity, access to new zone)
- ✅ Light Progression (collect > upgrade > access deeper zone)
- ✅ Static AI Text Messages (triggered at milestones)

### Why This First:

- Core loop must function and feel polished to pass G2P3.
- Establishes networking, progression, and player feedback.
- AI text messages hint at deeper narrative for judges.

---

## **Phase 2: Presentation & Narrative Immersion (If Phase 1 Finishes Early)**

**Goal:** Elevate atmosphere, immersion, and perceived depth through audio, visuals, and light narrative hooks.

### Additions:

- 🎙️ **AI Voice Broadcasts at Milestones**

  - Pre-scripted, unsettling corporate AI tones.
  - Triggered by upgrades, zone access, or trash milestones.

- 🎧 **Environmental Audio Pass**

  - Zone hums, static, broken transmissions.

- 🖼️ **Enhanced Visual Dressing**

  - Debris variety, small narrative props (e.g., branded wreckage).

- 🔁 **Zone Progression Expansion**

  - Add a "deeper" sub-zone with visual distinction.
  - Introduce new trash types for variety.

### Why This Second:

- High "bang for buck" on presentation polish.
- Builds on Phase 1 systems without major new mechanics.
- Strengthens worldbuilding for grader impression.

---

## **Phase 3: Extended Systems & Replayability (Post-G2P3 or Stretch)**

**Goal:** Deepen progression and interaction paths for replayability and differentiation.

### 3A. **AI Integration Progression (Augmentations Path)**

- Unlock speed, efficiency, access through "integration upgrades."
- Thematic alignment path: rogue > corp > AI hybrid.
- Impacts progression visuals and milestone messaging.

### 3B. **Light PvP Mechanics (Optional)**

- Cargo theft, light sabotage mechanics.
- Optional: toggled in rooms to avoid griefing.

### 3C. **Branching Progression (Narrative Impact)**

- Separate trees for rogue, corp, AI; slight mechanical differences.
- Affects messaging tone, maybe visuals.

### 3D. **Player-to-Player Barter (Nice-to-Have)**

- Simple in-zone barter menu (no persistent economy).
- Encourages emergent stories but adds networking/state complexity.

### Why This Last:

- Most impactful for long-term depth but higher scope and polish risk.
- All depend on Phase 1 progression and Phase 2 polish working smoothly.
