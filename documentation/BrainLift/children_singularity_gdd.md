# Children of the Singularity

## Game Design Document (Core Concept Focus)

---

## 1. Game Overview

**Title:** Children of the Singularity  
**Genre:** 2D / 2.5D Multiplayer Sci-Fi Salvage Sim  
**Tone:** Wacky dystopian sci-fi with eerie corporate and AI undertones  
**Art Style:** Moebius-inspired, colorful yet decayed  
**Inspiration:** Planetes, Moebius, Nausicaa, Bakaarts, Hardspace Shipbreaker

### High Concept
A multiplayer game where players collect space trash in crowded orbital zones, upgrade their salvage systems, trade in NPC hubs, and gradually uncover a mysterious AI-managed ecosystem controlling space debris and humanity itself. Play as a rogue salvager, corporate drone, or evolve into something more alien.

## 2. Core Gameplay Loop

**Explore Zones → Collect Trash → Trade / Upgrade → Expand Capabilities → Uncover AI Ecosystem**

### Player Actions:
- Navigate debris-filled zones in a stylized 2D/2.5D space.
- Collect various types of trash (satellites, biotech waste, derelict AI components).
- Sell or trade with NPC hubs or barter casually with players.
- Upgrade ship, tools, and augment self toward efficiency or post-human capabilities.
- Encounter AI messages, transmissions, and strange behavior over time.

### Progression Paths:
- Stay rogue: Independent scavenger, free but limited.
- Become corporate: Efficiency and profit-focused upgrades.
- Integrate with AI: Gain augmentations, speed, and insight, lose humanity.

## 3. Narrative & Worldbuilding

### Storytelling Style:
- Ambient worldbuilding through environmental cues.
- Mysterious AI broadcasts and private transmissions.
- Slow-burn narrative revealed through progression and exploration.
- No hard exposition; discovery through action.

### Key Themes:
- The commodification of labor.
- Decay, waste, and post-human evolution.
- The illusion of choice under AI management.
- Corporate politeness masking eerie manipulation.

### Tone:
- Corporate bureaucracy meets eldritch AI.
- Wry humor, absurd procedures, unsettling diplomacy.

## 4. Systems Design

### Core Systems:
| System         | Notes                                 |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| Trash Collection | Likely automated/minigame-based for feasibility. Possible physics-lite minigame. |
| Upgrades       | Ships, tools, AI augmentations (speed, efficiency, access). |
| Trading        | NPC hubs for selling, bartering. No auction house. |
| AI Integration | Voice communications at milestones. Broadcasts or private events. |
| Multiplayer    | Persistent zones, solo-friendly with optional light PvP (theft/sabotage TBD). |

### AI Interaction:
- Polite, unsettling corporate voice.
- Communicates through broadcasts or private messages.
- Appears more as player progresses or approaches key thresholds.

### Progression:
- Access deeper zones with upgrades.
- Encounter rare trash with narrative significance.
- Move toward philosophical alignment (rogue, corporate, AI).
- Endless loops with soft resets or player-chosen reset points.

---

## 5. Multiplayer Design

### Structure:
- Small persistent multiplayer zones.
- Interaction encouraged but not required.
- Static economy, indirect player impact.
- Trade hubs allow light bartering.

### Player-to-Player:
- Optional cooperation.
- Possible light competitive elements (stealing cargo).
- Shared zones, but progression is largely personal.

---

## 6. Presentation & Audio

### Visual Style:
- 2D / 2.5D stylized Moebius-esque visuals.
- Colorful, cluttered, surreal debris fields.
- Dense space zones with derelicts and abandoned tech.

### Audio Direction:
- Polite, eerie AI voices (corporate, unsettling).
- Environmental sounds: static, hum, broken transmissions.
- Music: Ambient synth, glitchy, distant.

---

## 7. Development Scope & Feasibility

### Target Scope:
- Solo developer-friendly.
- Small persistent multiplayer scale.
- Polished, self-contained experience.
- No heavy social or faction systems.

### Priorities:
- Core loop polish (explore, collect, trade, upgrade).
- Atmospheric worldbuilding through audio, visuals.
- Gradual AI narrative reveals.
- Light multiplayer interactions.

### Technologies:
- Unity or Godot (2D / 2.5D).
- Basic networking (Photon, Mirror).
- Potential Whisper integration for voice input.

---

## 8. Target Audience

### Primary:
- Casual co-op players.
- Sci-fi enthusiasts.

### Secondary:
- Fans of emergent storytelling.
- Those drawn to weird, atmospheric, non-traditional sci-fi games.

## 9. Key Differentiators

| Feature                     | Why It’s Unique                         |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Moebius-style dystopia        | Distinctive art direction.               |
| Trash collection as metaphor  | Commentary on labor, decay, AI systems.   |
| Optional AI Voice Interaction | Immersive narrative device.               |
| Blend of humor and unease     | Memorable, offbeat tone.                 |

## 10. Next Steps

1. Prototype core loop: Explore > Collect > Trade > Upgrade.
2. Develop visual style mockups (key art, UI concepts).
3. Build small zone with basic AI communications.
4. Establish networking framework.
5. Begin ambient narrative writing and AI interaction scripting.
