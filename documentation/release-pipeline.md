# üöÄ Release Pipeline Documentation

This document explains how to use the automated release pipeline for Children of the Singularity with AWS S3 integration.

## Overview

The release pipeline consists of:
- **Local Build System**: Enhanced `build.sh` script for development and local releases
- **Release Manager**: `scripts/release-manager.sh` for managing versions and triggering releases
- **AWS S3 Integration**: `scripts/s3-manager.sh` for cloud storage and distribution
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated multi-platform builds and release creation with S3 upload
- **Release Cleanup**: Automatic deletion of old releases (keeps only the latest)

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a New Release

```bash
# Create a git tag and trigger automated release
./scripts/release-manager.sh create v1.0.0 "Initial release"
./scripts/release-manager.sh github v1.0.0

# Or create a pre-release
./scripts/release-manager.sh github v1.1.0-beta true

# Local release with S3 upload
./scripts/release-manager.sh local v1.0.0 true
```

### 1a. AWS S3 Setup (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
# Install AWS CLI
brew install awscli  # macOS
# or pip install awscli

# Configure AWS credentials
aws configure

# Setup S3 bucket for releases
./scripts/s3-manager.sh setup

# Test S3 connection
./scripts/s3-manager.sh check
```

### 2. Monitor Release Progress

```bash
# Check workflow status
gh run list --workflow=release.yml

# View real-time logs  
gh run view --log
```

### 3. Download and Test

Once the workflow completes, releases are available at:
`https://github.com/GauntletAI/Children_of_Singularity/releases`

## Build System

### Local Development

```bash
# Development/testing
./build.sh dev          # Run game in development mode
./build.sh debug        # Validate without graphics
./build.sh status       # Check build environment

# Local building (requires Godot export templates)
./build.sh dist         # Build distribution packages
./build.sh release      # Build complete release packages
./build.sh clean        # Clean build directories

# S3 integration (requires AWS CLI configured)
./build.sh upload-assets        # Upload development assets to S3
./build.sh download-assets      # Download assets from S3
./build.sh s3-status           # Show S3 storage information

# Environment variables for S3
export USE_S3_STORAGE=true     # Enable S3 upload for releases
export USE_S3_ASSETS=true      # Enable S3 for assets
export S3_BUCKET_NAME=my-bucket # Override default bucket name
```

### Release Manager

```bash
# Version management
./scripts/release-manager.sh create v1.0.0 "Release message"
./scripts/release-manager.sh delete v1.0.0
./scripts/release-manager.sh list

# Local releases
./scripts/release-manager.sh local v1.0.0        # Local only
./scripts/release-manager.sh local v1.0.0 true   # Local + S3 upload

# S3 release management
./scripts/release-manager.sh s3 upload v1.0.0    # Upload existing release
./scripts/release-manager.sh s3 download v1.0.0  # Download from S3
./scripts/release-manager.sh s3 list             # List S3 releases
./scripts/release-manager.sh s3 urls v1.0.0      # Get download URLs
./scripts/release-manager.sh s3 public v1.0.0    # Make publicly accessible

# GitHub integration
./scripts/release-manager.sh github v1.0.0
./scripts/release-manager.sh status              # Shows local + S3 status
```

### S3 Manager (Direct Usage)

```bash
# Setup and configuration
./scripts/s3-manager.sh setup                    # Create bucket and policies
./scripts/s3-manager.sh check                    # Verify AWS configuration

# Release management
./scripts/s3-manager.sh upload-release v1.0.0 releases/v1.0.0/
./scripts/s3-manager.sh download-release v1.0.0
./scripts/s3-manager.sh list-releases
./scripts/s3-manager.sh get-urls v1.0.0 86400    # 24-hour URLs

# Asset management
./scripts/s3-manager.sh upload-assets assets/ sprites/
./scripts/s3-manager.sh download-assets sprites/ assets/

# Maintenance
./scripts/s3-manager.sh cleanup-dev 7            # Clean builds older than 7 days
./scripts/s3-manager.sh storage-info             # Show storage usage
```

## GitHub Actions Workflow

### Triggers

The release workflow triggers on:
1. **Git tags**: Push a tag matching `v*` pattern (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
2. **Manual dispatch**: Run manually from GitHub Actions tab

### Workflow Steps

1. **üßπ Cleanup Old Releases**: Deletes all existing releases to keep only the latest
2. **üéÆ Build Game**:
   - Uses Godot 4.4.1 in Docker container
   - Builds for Windows, macOS, and Linux
   - Creates compressed archives for each platform
   - Generates comprehensive release notes
   - **‚òÅÔ∏è Upload to S3** (if configured): Uploads builds to S3 with extended retention
3. **üè∑Ô∏è Create Release**:
   - Creates new GitHub release
   - Uploads all platform archives
   - Adds detailed release notes with installation instructions
   - **‚òÅÔ∏è S3 Release Summary** (if configured): Shows S3 storage info and download URLs

### Platform Support

### Platform Archives (GitHub Releases)
- `Children_of_Singularity_v1.0.0_Windows.zip`
- `Children_of_Singularity_v1.0.0_macOS.zip`  
- `Children_of_Singularity_v1.0.0_Linux.tar.gz`

### S3 Storage (if enabled)
- Same archives stored in S3 with extended retention
- Automatic lifecycle management (Standard ‚Üí IA ‚Üí Glacier)
- Pre-signed download URLs for secure access
- Release manifest with build metadata

### Content Structure
```
Children_of_Singularity_v1.0.0_Windows.zip
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Children_of_Singularity.exe     # Game executable
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                       # Project information
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE                         # License file
```

### Release Notes
Auto-generated with:
- Build information (version, commit, date)
- Platform download links
- Installation instructions
- System requirements
- Game features overview
- Known issues
- Support information

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Export Templates Missing**
```bash
# Check status
./build.sh status

# Install templates in Godot Editor:
# Editor ‚Üí Manage Export Templates ‚Üí Download
```

**GitHub CLI Not Authenticated**
```bash
# Re-authenticate
gh auth login

# Check status
gh auth status
```

**Build Failures**
```bash
# Check export presets
./build.sh status

# Clean and retry
./build.sh clean
./scripts/release-manager.sh local v1.0.0
```

**Release Cleanup Issues**
```bash
# Manual cleanup
gh release list
gh release delete v1.0.0

# Or use script
./scripts/release-manager.sh delete v1.0.0
```

### Debugging

**Verbose Workflow Logs**
```bash
# View detailed logs with timestamps
gh run view --log

# Follow specific job
gh run view --job=build-game --log
```

**Local Testing**
```bash
# Test build locally before GitHub release
./scripts/release-manager.sh local v1.0.0-test

# Check output
ls -la releases/v1.0.0-test/
```

## Security Considerations

- Release artifacts are excluded from git (`.gitignore`)
- GitHub token permissions limited to releases scope
- No sensitive data in release notes or artifacts
- Export templates verified during build process
- S3 access uses IAM credentials with least-privilege permissions
- Pre-signed URLs for secure, time-limited downloads
- S3 bucket versioning enabled for data protection
- Lifecycle policies prevent indefinite storage costs

## Performance

- **Build Time**: ~5-10 minutes for all platforms (+ 1-2 minutes for S3 upload)
- **Artifact Size**: ~50-100MB per platform
- **Cleanup**: Old releases deleted before new ones created
- **Retention**: Build artifacts kept for 1 day in GitHub Actions, extended retention in S3
- **S3 Storage Classes**:
  - Standard (0-30 days)
  - Standard-IA (30-90 days)
  - Glacier (90+ days)
  - Development builds auto-deleted after 7 days
