- [x] Custom game icon integrated (PNG + SVG fallback)
- [x] **VERIFIED**: Project launches without errors

#### Core Game Scripts (GDScript)
- [x] `scripts/ZoneMain.gd` - Zone controller with signal system
- [x] `scripts/PlayerShip.gd` - Player movement and inventory
- [x] `scripts/NetworkManager.gd` - ENet networking stubs
- [x] `scripts/InventoryManager.gd` - Item management system
- [x] `scripts/AICommunicator.gd` - AI interaction system
- [x] **VERIFIED**: All scripts load without compilation errors

#### Backend Services
- [x] `backend/app.py` - Complete FastAPI application
- [x] `backend/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- [x] RESTful API endpoints for players, inventory, zones
- [x] Pydantic models for data validation
- [x] CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- [x] **VERIFIED**: API endpoints responding correctly
  - Health: `{"status":"healthy","timestamp":"2025-07-14T12:44:30.224905"}`
  - Stats: `{"total_players":1,"total_inventory_items":0,"total_zones":0}`

#### Database Layer
- [x] `data/postgres/schema.sql` - Complete PostgreSQL schema
- [x] All required tables (players, inventory, upgrades, zones, etc.)
- [x] Indexes for performance optimization
- [x] Sample data for development testing
- [x] Analytics support tables
- [x] **VERIFIED**: Backend using stub data successfully

#### Scene Structure
- [x] `scenes/zones/ZoneMain.tscn` - Main game scene
- [x] **VERIFIED**: Scene loads without parse errors
- [x] **VERIFIED**: Player initialization: `[2025-07-14T12:44:41] PlayerShip: Player ship ready for gameplay`

### ‚úÖ All Completion Criteria Met

1. **Project launches with correct structure** ‚úÖ
2. **All core folders/files present and tracked** ‚úÖ
3. **Minimal scene loads with no errors** ‚úÖ
4. **Networking/backend stubs exist (functional)** ‚úÖ
5. **README and logs confirm setup** ‚úÖ

### üéØ Phase 1 Results
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **All systems operational**: Backend API, Godot project, scene loading, script compilation
- **Ready for Phase 2**: Basic gameplay implementation
- **Technical debt**: Database still using stubs (acceptable for Phase 1)

### üîÑ Next Phase Preparation
**Phase 2: MVP Development**
- Implement basic player movement mechanics
- Add debris collection system
- Establish client-server communication
- Create basic UI elements
- Add simple multiplayer functionality

### üìä Code Quality Metrics
- **GDScript**: Strict typing enforced, comprehensive logging throughout
- **Python**: Type hints used, Pydantic validation implemented
- **SQL**: Proper indexing, foreign key constraints
- **Documentation**: Extensive inline comments and docstrings
- **Testing**: Backend endpoints verified, Godot project launch confirmed

### üèÜ Phase 1 Achievement
**All foundational systems established and verified operational**
- 100% of Phase 1 deliverables completed
- Zero blocking issues identified
- Ready to proceed to Phase 2 MVP development
