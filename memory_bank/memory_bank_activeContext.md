## 🔧 **Signal Architecture Fix Details**

### Problem Identified
```gdscript
# PROBLEMATIC PATTERN (Before Fix):
func _on_removal_confirm_pressed() -> void:
    # Signal connections done conditionally during operations
    if not TradingMarketplace.listing_removed.is_connected(_on_listing_removal_result):
        TradingMarketplace.listing_removed.connect(_on_listing_removal_result)
    TradingMarketplace.remove_listing(listing_id)
```

### Solution Implemented  
```gdscript
# ROBUST PATTERN (After Fix):
func _connect_trading_interface_buttons() -> void:
    # All signals connected once during initialization
    if TradingMarketplace:
        TradingMarketplace.listings_received.connect(_on_marketplace_listings_received)
        TradingMarketplace.listing_posted.connect(_on_item_posting_result)
        TradingMarketplace.listing_removed.connect(_on_listing_removal_result)
        TradingMarketplace.item_purchased.connect(_on_item_purchase_result)
        TradingMarketplace.api_error.connect(_on_marketplace_api_error)

func _on_removal_confirm_pressed() -> void:
    # Simple operation call - signals already connected
    TradingMarketplace.remove_listing(listing_id)
```

### Impact
- **Before**: Listing removal showed "Removing listing..." but required manual refresh to see changes
- **After**: All marketplace operations automatically update UI immediately
- **Reliability**: Eliminates signal connection timing issues and race conditions
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner code with centralized signal management
