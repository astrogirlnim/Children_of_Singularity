# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
**Phase 1: Setup (Barebones Framework)**  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - All foundational systems operational and verified

## Phase 1 Completion Summary
**Date**: July 14, 2025  
**Result**: 100% Complete - All deliverables achieved

### Final Verification Results
1. ✅ **Godot Project**: Launches without errors, scene loads correctly
2. ✅ **Backend API**: All endpoints operational and responding
3. ✅ **Scripts**: All GDScript files compile and initialize properly
4. ✅ **Database**: Schema in place, backend using functional stubs
5. ✅ **Documentation**: README accurate, comprehensive logging implemented

### Key Accomplishments
- **Project Structure**: Complete directory hierarchy established
- **Core Systems**: All foundational scripts implemented with strict typing
- **Backend Services**: FastAPI application with full endpoint suite
- **Database Schema**: PostgreSQL schema with analytics support
- **Version Control**: All files tracked, commits up to date
- **Testing**: Manual verification of all critical paths

### Final API Test Results
- **Health Check**: `{"status":"healthy","timestamp":"2025-07-14T12:44:30.224905"}`
- **Stats Endpoint**: `{"total_players":1,"total_inventory_items":0,"total_zones":0}`
- **Player Endpoints**: Proper error handling and response structure

### Final Godot Test Results
- **Project Launch**: Successful without errors
- **Scene Loading**: ZoneMain.tscn loads without parse errors
- **Script Compilation**: All .gd files compile successfully
- **Player Initialization**: `[2025-07-14T12:44:41] PlayerShip: Player ship ready for gameplay`

### Issues Resolved
- **Path verification**: Confirmed proper venv path usage for backend
- **Scene loading**: ZoneMain.tscn functional and loading correctly
- **API endpoints**: All endpoints tested and responding appropriately

## Ready for Phase 2: MVP Development

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Implement basic player movement** - WASD/arrow key controls
2. **Add debris collection mechanics** - Click/space to collect items
3. **Establish client-server communication** - Basic networking between Godot and FastAPI
4. **Create basic UI elements** - Inventory display, HUD elements
5. **Add simple multiplayer foundation** - Multiple players in same zone

### Phase 2 Scope
- **Basic gameplay loop**: Move → collect → store → progress
- **Networking integration**: Real client-server communication
- **UI implementation**: Functional inventory and HUD
- **Database connectivity**: Move from stubs to real PostgreSQL
- **Multiplayer foundation**: Basic multi-player zone support

### Technical Foundation Ready
- **Architecture**: Client-server pattern established
- **Networking**: ENet stubs ready for implementation
- **Database**: Schema ready for real connections
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging throughout all systems
- **Code Quality**: Strict typing, proper error handling implemented

### Work Session Context
- Phase 1 requirements review completed
- All systems verified operational
- Memory bank updated with final status
- Ready to begin Phase 2 MVP development
