# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
**Phase 2.5: 2.5D Conversion - Day 5**  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Day 5 Complete - Backend Integration Operational

## Day 5 Summary - Backend Integration Complete
**Date**: January 2025  
**Result**: Complete backend integration for 3D coordinates achieved

### Day 5 Major Achievements
1. ‚úÖ **3D Position Sync** - ZoneMain3D syncs Vector3 coordinates to backend every 5 seconds
2. ‚úÖ **3D Debris Collection** - DebrisObject3D, PlayerShip3D, and ZoneDebrisManager3D handle 3D collection perfectly
3. ‚úÖ **Upgrade Effects in 3D** - PlayerShip3D has identical upgrade methods to 2D version, UpgradeSystem works flawlessly
4. ‚úÖ **API Testing Complete** - Backend accepts 3D player data with coordinates {"x": 10.5, "y": 2.0, "z": -5.3}
5. ‚úÖ **Godot 3D System Verification** - All classes load successfully, 30 debris spawned, complete system operational

### Backend Integration Status
- **Player Data API**: Successfully tested with 3D coordinates and upgrade data
- **Position Sync**: Automatic sync of Vector3 positions to backend database schema with position_z column
- **Debris Collection**: Full 3D collection mechanics integrated with backend data persistence
- **Upgrade System**: Complete compatibility between UpgradeSystem and PlayerShip3D upgrade methods
- **API Health**: Backend operational in fallback mode, all core endpoints functional

### Technical Implementation Details

- **Sync Strategy**: Position synced every 5 seconds when player moves >1 unit distance
- **Coordinate System**: Y=2.0 ship level, X-Z plane for movement, Y-axis for depth effects
- **Network Protocol**: 3D coordinates flow through NetworkManager ‚Üí APIClient ‚Üí Backend API

## Phase 2.5 Progress Summary
**Days 1-2**: ‚úÖ Core 3D Infrastructure - Scene conversion and player movement
**Day 3**: ‚úÖ 3D Debris System - Complete debris physics and collection
**Day 4**: ‚úÖ Environment & NPCs - Space stations, trading hubs, backgrounds

## Next Steps for Phase 2.5
**Day 6**: Visual Polish - Lighting, effects, and Moebius-inspired aesthetic
**Day 7**: UI Integration - 2D UI over 3D scene with world-space indicators  
**Day 8**: Multiplayer Implementation - ENet networking in 3D space
**Day 9**: UI Systems - Inventory, upgrade interfaces, trading improvements
**Day 10**: Testing & Polish - Performance optimization and final MVP preparation
