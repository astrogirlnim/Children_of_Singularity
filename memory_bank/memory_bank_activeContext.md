# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
**Phase 1: Setup (Barebones Framework)**  
**Status**: 90% Complete - Core infrastructure established, debugging scene loading issues

## Recent Accomplishments
1. ✅ **Godot Installation**: Successfully installed Godot 4.4.1 via Homebrew
2. ✅ **Project Structure**: Created complete directory structure matching documentation requirements
3. ✅ **Core Scripts**: Implemented all foundational GDScript files with comprehensive logging
4. ✅ **Backend API**: Complete FastAPI application with all required endpoints
5. ✅ **Database Schema**: Full PostgreSQL schema with sample data and analytics support
6. ✅ **Icon Integration**: Custom game icon (1024x1024 PNG) and fallback SVG created

## Current Issue: Scene Loading Error
**Problem**: ZoneMain.tscn fails to load with parse error at line 33  
**Root Cause**: Scene file may have been corrupted or deleted during icon updates  
**Impact**: Prevents project from launching in Godot

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **CRITICAL**: Recreate ZoneMain.tscn scene file
2. **CRITICAL**: Test project launch in Godot editor
3. **CRITICAL**: Verify all scripts load without errors
4. Start backend server and test API endpoints
5. Initialize PostgreSQL database with schema

## Work Session Context
- User requested icon integration using provided PNG file
- Successfully resized icon from 2.2MB to more manageable size
- Created SVG fallback icon with sci-fi salvage ship theme
- Encountered Godot scene parsing issues during icon integration
- User requested halt for memory bank creation and status documentation

## Ready for Next Session
- All infrastructure files are in place
- Backend and database are ready for testing
- Only scene recreation needed to resume development
- Comprehensive logging implemented throughout codebase
