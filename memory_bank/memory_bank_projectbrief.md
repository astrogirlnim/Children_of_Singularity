# Project Brief: Children of the Singularity

## Core Project Definition
**Name**: Children of the Singularity  
**Type**: 2D/2.5D Multiplayer Sci-Fi Salvage Simulation Game  
**Engine**: Godot 4.4.1  
**Architecture**: Client-Server with FastAPI Backend + PostgreSQL  

## Primary Goals
1. **Salvage Simulation**: Players collect space debris and salvage materials in procedurally generated zones
2. **AI-Driven Narrative**: Corporate AI system guides players through missions with eerie, polite interactions
3. **Multiplayer Experience**: Server-authoritative networking with real-time player interactions
4. **Progression Systems**: Ship upgrades, inventory management, and zone unlocking mechanics

## Core Requirements
- **Visual Style**: Moebius-inspired art with soft pastels, muted neons, dystopian sci-fi aesthetic
- **Networking**: ENet-based multiplayer with server authority
- **Backend**: RESTful API with PostgreSQL database for persistence
- **Audio**: AI voice synthesis for corporate communications
- **Platform**: Cross-platform desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Success Criteria
- Project launches without errors in Godot
- Basic player movement and debris collection functional
- Networking stubs operational for multiplayer foundation
- Backend API endpoints respond correctly
- Database schema supports all game systems
- AI communication system integrated

## Current Phase
**Phase 1: Setup (Barebones Framework)** - Establishing foundational project structure and validating tech stack integration.
