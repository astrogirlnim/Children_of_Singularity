# Summary of `getting_started/` Subdirectory in Godot Documentation

## Purpose
The `getting_started` section is a curated onboarding guide designed to take brand-new users from installation to shipping their first 2D and 3D games.  It mixes conceptual articles with hands-on, step-by-step tutorials and serves as the recommended entry point before diving into the full API reference.

* **Audience:** Absolute beginners to intermediate developers new to Godot.
* **Outcome:** Understand Godot’s design philosophy, editor workflow, core concepts (nodes, scenes, signals), and build playable game prototypes in both 2D and 3D.

## Core Principles Across the Getting-Started Docs
1. **Learning-by-Doing** – Each topic quickly transitions from theory to a runnable example.
2. **Iterative Complexity** – Tutorials start simple and gradually introduce new systems (input, physics, UI, animation).
3. **Scene-Oriented Thinking** – Early emphasis on nodes, scenes, instancing as the mental model for every project.
4. **Script-as-Glue** – GDScript (and other languages) are presented as lightweight glue between engine building blocks rather than monolithic gameplay classes.
5. **Editor-First Workflow** – Users are encouraged to leverage the editor for asset import, visual configuration, and debugging.
6. **Platform Agnosticism** – Guides avoid platform-specific code, focusing on Godot abstractions for maximum portability.

## Detailed File Summaries

### `introduction/`

#### `introduction_to_godot.rst`
Provides a big-picture overview: Godot’s history, open-source nature, supported platforms, and comparison to other engines.  Sets expectations for workflow and community resources.

#### `key_concepts_overview.rst`
Defines foundational ideas—nodes, scenes, resources, signals, groups.  Offers analogies and diagrams that reappear in later docs.

#### `godot_design_philosophy.rst`
Explains why Godot favors composition over inheritance, scene instancing, and a lightweight core.  Encourages modular design and rapid iteration.

#### `first_look_at_the_editor.rst`
Guided tour of editor panels: Scene tree, Inspector, FileSystem, Viewport.  Shows how to navigate, manipulate nodes, and customize layouts.

#### `learn_to_code_with_gdscript.rst`
Very short pitch for learning GDScript first; links to external resources and the language tour.

#### `learning_new_features.rst`
Advice on staying up-to-date: reading release notes, using official demos, and engaging with the community when new versions drop.

#### `index.rst`
Directory table-of-contents; no new concepts.

---

### `step_by_step/`

#### `nodes_and_scenes.rst`
Deep dive into the scene system, demonstrating how complex scenes are composed, instanced, and saved as reusable assets.

#### `instancing.rst`
Shows the power of dynamic instancing at runtime—spawning bullets, enemies, UI pop-ups—and organising packed scenes as factories.

#### `signals.rst`
Comprehensive explanation of Godot’s observer pattern.  Covers built-in signals, custom signals, connecting via editor or code, and best practices for decoupling.

#### `scripting_languages.rst`
Compares GDScript, C#, C++, and Visual Scripting.  Outlines pros/cons, performance notes, and how to choose.

#### `scripting_first_script.rst`
Hands-on creation of a GDScript attached to a node.  Teaches the `_ready()` and `_process(delta)` callbacks, exporting variables, and debugging prints.

#### `scripting_player_input.rst`
Introduces the InputMap, action names, and reading input in script.  Demonstrates basic character movement using `_physics_process()`.

#### `index.rst`
Table-of-contents.

### `first_2d_game/`
This series constructs a simple top-down shooter.

| File | Focus |
|------|-------|
| `01.project_setup.rst` | Creating a new project, importing art, configuring project settings |
| `02.player_scene.rst` | Building a `Player` scene with collision and sprite |
| `03.coding_the_player.rst` | Movement code, shooting bullets, clamping, delta time |
| `04.creating_the_enemy.rst` | Enemy scene, path following, basic AI |
| `05.the_main_game_scene.rst` | Assembling player, enemies, background into root scene |
| `06.heads_up_display.rst` | Label nodes for score/health, using `CanvasLayer` |
| `07.finishing-up.rst` | Adding sounds, polish, exporting the game |
| `index.rst` | Navigation page |

Key takeaways: incremental scene workflow, separation of concerns, and use of signals to notify HUD of score changes.
