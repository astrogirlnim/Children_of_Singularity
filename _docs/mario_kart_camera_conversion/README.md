# Mario Kart 8 Style Camera Conversion Plan

## Project Overview

Converting Children of the Singularity from the current 2.5D orthogonal camera system to a Mario Kart 8 style perspective camera with behind-the-ship following and constrained movement controls.

## Current State Assessment

### âœ… Already Implemented
- **3D Infrastructure**: Complete 3D scene with PlayerShip3D, debris system, and zone boundaries
- **Camera System**: CameraController3D with orthogonal projection and zoom functionality
- **Movement**: Free X-Z plane movement with gravity on Y-axis
- **Physics**: RigidBody3D debris with collection areas
- **Zone Boundaries**: Invisible collision walls constraining play area
- **Debris Collection**: Working 3D collection system with 5 debris types

### ðŸŽ¯ Target Mario Kart 8 Features
- **Perspective Camera**: Behind-the-ship camera with perspective projection
- **Smooth Following**: Camera follows ship rotation with configurable lag
- **Zoomable Viewport**: Maintain current zoom functionality (critical requirement)
- **Camera Tilt**: Optional banking effect when turning upward
- **Constrained Movement**: Forward/backward + steering instead of free movement
- **Momentum Physics**: Space-appropriate momentum and inertia
- **Ship Rotation**: Use rotating gif frames for directional facing

## Technical Requirements

### Ship Rotation Animation
- **Source Asset**: `documentation/design/sprite_assets/ship_animation/ship_sprite_concept_vibrant.gif`
- **Implementation**: Extract frames and create rotation-based sprite switching
- **Orientation**: Ship faces movement direction for Mario Kart feel

### Camera Specifications
- **Projection**: Perspective (75-90 degree FOV, Mario Kart style)
- **Position**: Behind ship at configurable distance
- **Following**: Smooth lag for cinematic feel
- **Zoom**: Keep current zoom system (min/max/mouse wheel controls)
- **Tilt**: Camera can bank when ship turns upward

### Movement System
- **Forward/Backward**: Accelerate/decelerate along ship's facing direction  
- **Steering**: Left/right turn ship orientation, not immediate lateral movement
- **Momentum**: Physics-based momentum for space environment
- **Boundaries**: Respect existing zone boundary collision system

- **Animation Smoothness**: Optimize frame switching for fluid rotation

### Gameplay Risks
- **Collection Difficulty**: New movement may make debris collection harder
- **Learning Curve**: Players need to adapt to steering-based movement

### Mitigation Strategies
- Incremental testing after each phase
- Configurable parameters for easy tuning
- Backup current 3D system before major changes
- Performance profiling throughout development

## Dependencies

### Assets Required
- Ship rotation frames extracted from `ship_sprite_concept_vibrant.gif`
- No new art assets needed beyond existing sprites

### Systems Integration
- Must maintain compatibility with existing debris collection
- Zone boundary system integration required
- API client and upgrade system compatibility
- Network manager integration for multiplayer

## Timeline

**Total Estimated Time**: 5 days
- **Phase 1**: 1 day (Camera conversion)
- **Phase 2**: 1 day (Movement system)
- **Phase 3**: 1 day (Ship rotation)
- **Phase 4**: 1 day (Camera polish)
- **Phase 5**: 1 day (Integration & testing)

This plan prioritizes getting the core Mario Kart 8 feel established quickly, then adding polish and effects. Each phase builds on the previous while maintaining the existing debris collection gameplay that's already working well.
