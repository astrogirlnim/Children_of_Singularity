# 2.5D MVP Roadmap for Children of the Singularity

## Executive Summary

This roadmap outlines the path from the current 2D implementation to a polished 2.5D MVP, incorporating insights from the [YouTube tutorial on 2.5D tricks in Godot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK5qpEmUA6w).

## Current State Assessment

### âœ… Completed (75% of Phase 2)
- Backend API integration fully operational
- Trading system with credit management
- Complete upgrade system (6 types)
- Enhanced player movement and inventory
- Zone management system

### ðŸ”„ Remaining for MVP (25%)
- Multiplayer networking (ENet implementation)
- UI/UX interfaces (inventory, upgrades)
- AI messaging system
- **NEW: 2.5D visual conversion**

## 2.5D Conversion Benefits for MVP

### Why Convert Now?
1. **Visual Impact**: Dramatically enhanced presentation for MVP showcase
2. **Automatic Depth Sorting**: Eliminates Y-sorting bugs common in 2D
3. **Dynamic Lighting**: Adds atmosphere with minimal art assets
4. **Performance**: Better optimization options (LOD, occlusion culling)
5. **Future-Proofing**: Easier to add visual effects and polish later

### Key Insights from YouTube Tutorial
- **Collision boxes must be wider than sprites** - prevents clipping
- **Camera distance crucial** - avoid near-plane clipping
- **Sprite import settings** - Force sRGB, Fix Alpha Border
- **Floor detection** - Set floor_normal for proper physics
- **Velocity reset** - Prevents floating against ceilings

## Phased Implementation Plan

### Phase A: Core 3D Infrastructure (2 days)
**Goal**: Get basic 3D scene running with player movement

#### Day 1: Scene Conversion

- [x] Add DirectionalLight3D and WorldEnvironment
- [x] Create basic test geometry (floor plane)

#### Day 2: Player Conversion
- [ ] Create PlayerShip3D scene and script
- [ ] Implement movement on X-Z plane
- [ ] Configure Sprite3D with billboard mode
- [ ] Set up wider collision box than sprite
- [ ] Test movement and camera following

### Phase B: Game Systems in 3D (3 days)
**Goal**: Port all existing game systems to 3D

#### Day 3: Debris System
- [ ] Create Debris3D scenes
- [ ] Update spawning logic for 3D space
- [ ] Implement collection mechanics with Area3D
- [ ] Add floating animation and rotation

#### Day 4: Environment & NPCs
- [ ] Create space station modules in 3D
- [ ] Implement NPC hub areas
- [ ] Set up zone boundaries
- [ ] Add background elements for depth

#### Day 5: Backend Integration
- [ ] Update position sync for 3D coordinates
- [ ] Modify debris collection to work with 3D
- [ ] Ensure upgrade effects work in 3D
- [ ] Test all API endpoints with 3D data

### Phase C: Visual Polish (2 days)
**Goal**: Achieve Moebius-inspired aesthetic in 3D

#### Day 6: Lighting & Effects
- [ ] Fine-tune DirectionalLight3D for shadows
- [ ] Configure ambient occlusion
- [ ] Add vignette and color grading
- [ ] Implement particle effects for thrusters

#### Day 7: UI Integration
- [ ] Ensure 2D UI renders over 3D scene
- [ ] Add world-space indicators
- [ ] Create 3D collection feedback
- [ ] Polish visual transitions

### Phase D: Multiplayer & Final MVP (3 days)
**Goal**: Complete remaining MVP features with 2.5D

#### Day 8: Multiplayer Implementation
- [ ] Implement ENet networking in 3D
- [ ] Sync player positions in 3D space
- [ ] Handle debris collection conflicts
- [ ] Test with multiple clients

#### Day 9: UI Systems
- [ ] Create inventory interface
- [ ] Build upgrade selection UI
- [ ] Implement trading interface improvements
- [ ] Add AI message overlay system

#### Day 10: Testing & Polish
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Bug fixes and edge cases
- [ ] Final visual polish
- [ ] Prepare for MVP showcase

## Technical Considerations

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Collision Box Width**: Must be wider than sprites (2x recommended)
2. **Camera Setup**: Position at 30Â° angle, far enough to avoid clipping
3. **Movement Plane**: Constrain to X-Z, use Y only for effects
4. **Sprite Import**: Force sRGB and Fix Alpha Border on all textures
5. **Performance**: Target 60 FPS with 50+ debris objects

### Risk Mitigation
- **Backup Strategy**: Keep 2D version as fallback
- **Incremental Testing**: Test each system as converted
- **Performance Monitoring**: Profile frequently
- **Art Asset Reuse**: All 2D sprites work as Sprite3D

## File Change Summary

### Files to Modify
1. `project.godot` - Add 3D settings
2. `scripts/PlayerShip.gd` â†’ `scripts/PlayerShip3D.gd`
3. `scripts/ZoneMain.gd` â†’ `scripts/ZoneMain3D.gd`
4. `scripts/DebrisObject.gd` â†’ `scripts/DebrisObject3D.gd`

### New Files to Create
1. `scenes/zones/ZoneMain3D.tscn`
2. `scenes/player/PlayerShip3D.tscn`
3. `scenes/objects/Debris3D.tscn`
4. `scenes/environment/SpaceEnvironment.tscn`
5. `scripts/CameraController3D.gd`

### Assets to Re-import
- All sprite textures with 3D preset
- Force sRGB enabled
- Fix Alpha Border enabled

## Success Metrics

### MVP Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Game runs at 60 FPS on mid-range hardware
- [ ] All Phase 2 features functional in 3D
- [ ] Visual style matches Moebius inspiration
- [ ] Multiplayer supports 4+ concurrent players
- [ ] No visual clipping or z-fighting issues
- [ ] UI remains intuitive and readable

### Visual Quality Checklist
- [ ] Dynamic shadows enhance depth perception
- [ ] Debris has visual variety through Y-positioning
- [ ] Space station has layered, cluttered appearance
- [ ] Particle effects add life to the scene
- [ ] Color palette maintains soft pastels/muted neons

## Conclusion

Converting to 2.5D will elevate Children of the Singularity's visual presentation while solving common 2D issues. The 10-day timeline allows for careful implementation and testing, ensuring a polished MVP that showcases both technical capability and artistic vision.

The combination of completed backend systems (75%) and new 2.5D visuals will create a compelling MVP that stands out in the G2P3 showcase.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Review this roadmap with stakeholders
2. **Day 0**: Set up development environment for 3D
3. **Day 1**: Begin Phase A implementation
4. **Daily**: Update progress tracking in `memory_bank/`

Remember: "A 2.5D game with depth is better than a flat 2D game with bugs."
