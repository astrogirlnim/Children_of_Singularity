# 2.5D MVP Roadmap for Children of the Singularity

## Executive Summary

This roadmap outlines the path from the current 2D implementation to a polished 2.5D MVP, incorporating insights from the [YouTube tutorial on 2.5D tricks in Godot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK5qpEmUA6w).

## Current State Assessment

### ‚úÖ Completed (75% of Phase 2)
- Backend API integration fully operational
- Trading system with credit management
- Complete upgrade system (6 types)
- Enhanced player movement and inventory
- Zone management system

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED: 2.5D Core Infrastructure
- **Phase A: Core 3D Infrastructure** - 100% complete
- 3D scene running with player movement
- Camera3D with orthogonal projection
- DirectionalLight3D with shadows
- Player ship with Sprite3D and billboard mode
- Wide collision boxes for proper 3D physics
- High-resolution sprite with proper scaling (pixel_size: 0.0055)

### üîÑ Remaining for MVP (25%)
- **Phase B: Game Systems in 3D** - debris/objects system
- **Phase C: Visual Polish** - lighting and effects
- **Phase D: Multiplayer & UI** - ENet networking and interfaces
- AI messaging system integration

## 2.5D Conversion Benefits for MVP

### Why Convert Now?
1. **Visual Impact**: Dramatically enhanced presentation for MVP showcase
2. **Automatic Depth Sorting**: Eliminates Y-sorting bugs common in 2D
3. **Dynamic Lighting**: Adds atmosphere with minimal art assets
4. **Performance**: Better optimization options (LOD, occlusion culling)
5. **Future-Proofing**: Easier to add visual effects and polish later

### Key Insights from YouTube Tutorial
- **Collision boxes must be wider than sprites** - prevents clipping
- **Camera distance crucial** - avoid near-plane clipping
- **Sprite import settings** - Force sRGB, Fix Alpha Border
- **Floor detection** - Set floor_normal for proper physics
- **Velocity reset** - Prevents floating against ceilings

- [ ] Modify debris collection to work with 3D
- [ ] Ensure upgrade effects work in 3D
- [ ] Test all API endpoints with 3D data

- [ ] Add world-space indicators
- [ ] Create 3D collection feedback
- [ ] Polish visual transitions

### Phase D: Multiplayer & Final MVP (3 days)
**Goal**: Complete remaining MVP features with 2.5D

#### Day 8: Multiplayer Implementation
- [ ] Implement ENet networking in 3D
- [ ] Sync player positions in 3D space
- [ ] Handle debris collection conflicts
- [ ] Test with multiple clients

#### Day 9: UI Systems
- [ ] Create inventory interface
- [ ] Build upgrade selection UI
- [ ] Implement trading interface improvements
- [ ] Add AI message overlay system

#### Day 10: Testing & Polish
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Bug fixes and edge cases
- [ ] Final visual polish
- [ ] Prepare for MVP showcase

## Technical Considerations

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Collision Box Width**: Must be wider than sprites (2x recommended)
2. **Camera Setup**: Position at 30¬∞ angle, far enough to avoid clipping
3. **Movement Plane**: Constrain to X-Z, use Y only for effects
4. **Sprite Import**: Force sRGB and Fix Alpha Border on all textures
5. **Performance**: Target 60 FPS with 50+ debris objects

### Risk Mitigation
- **Backup Strategy**: Keep 2D version as fallback
- **Incremental Testing**: Test each system as converted
- **Performance Monitoring**: Profile frequently
- **Art Asset Reuse**: All 2D sprites work as Sprite3D

## File Change Summary

### Files to Modify
1. ‚úÖ `project.godot` - Add 3D settings
2. ‚úÖ `scripts/PlayerShip.gd` ‚Üí `scripts/PlayerShip3D.gd`
3. ‚úÖ `scripts/ZoneMain.gd` ‚Üí `scripts/ZoneMain3D.gd`
4. ‚úÖ `scripts/DebrisObject.gd` ‚Üí `scripts/DebrisObject3D.gd`

### New Files to Create
1. ‚úÖ `scenes/zones/ZoneMain3D.tscn`
2. ‚úÖ `scenes/player/PlayerShip3D.tscn`
3. ‚úÖ `scenes/objects/Debris3D.tscn`
4. ‚úÖ `scenes/environment/SpaceEnvironment.tres`
5. ‚úÖ `scripts/CameraController3D.gd`
6. ‚úÖ `scripts/ZoneDebrisManager3D.gd`

- ‚úÖ Fix Alpha Border enabled

## Success Metrics

### MVP Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Game runs at 60 FPS on mid-range hardware
- ‚ö†Ô∏è All Phase 2 features functional in 3D (backend systems working, some UI/collection issues)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Visual style matches Moebius inspiration (basic 3D working, needs visual polish)
- [ ] Multiplayer supports 4+ concurrent players
- [x] No visual clipping or z-fighting issues
- [x] UI remains intuitive and readable

### Visual Quality Checklist
- [ ] Dynamic shadows enhance depth perception
- [ ] Debris has visual variety through Y-positioning
- [ ] Space station has layered, cluttered appearance
- [ ] Particle effects add life to the scene
- [ ] Color palette maintains soft pastels/muted neons

## Conclusion

Converting to 2.5D will elevate Children of the Singularity's visual presentation while solving common 2D issues. The 10-day timeline allows for careful implementation and testing, ensuring a polished MVP that showcases both technical capability and artistic vision.

The combination of completed backend systems (75%) and new 2.5D visuals will create a compelling MVP that stands out in the G2P3 showcase.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Review this roadmap with stakeholders
2. **Day 0**: Set up development environment for 3D
3. **Day 1**: Begin Phase A implementation
4. **Daily**: Update progress tracking in `memory_bank/`

Remember: "A 2.5D game with depth is better than a flat 2D game with bugs."
