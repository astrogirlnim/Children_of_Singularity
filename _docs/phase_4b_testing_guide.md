### **Verification Checklist**

**For Each Upgrade Type:**
- [ ] Purchase completes successfully
- [ ] Credits deducted correctly
- [ ] Console logs show effect application
- [ ] Visual effects appear immediately
- [ ] Gameplay behavior changes appropriately
- [ ] UI updates reflect new values
- [ ] Effects stack correctly with multiple levels

### **Visual Effects to Watch For**

2. **Inventory Expansion**: Green expansion animations, capacity UI updates  
3. **Collection Efficiency**: Yellow range indicators, collection area visualization
4. **Debris Scanner**: Scanning pulse effects, debris highlighting
5. **Cargo Magnet**: Magnetic field effects, auto-collection animations
6. **Zone Access**: Access level indicators, zone unlock notifications

### **Debugging Commands (if needed)**

**Force apply upgrade directly:**
```gdscript
# In debug console or script
player_ship.apply_upgrade("speed_boost", 2)
player_ship.apply_upgrade("inventory_expansion", 1)
```

**Check current upgrade states:**
```gdscript
print("Speed: ", player_ship.speed)
print("Inventory Capacity: ", player_ship.inventory_capacity)  
print("Collection Range: ", player_ship.collection_range)
print("Scanner Active: ", player_ship.is_scanner_active)
print("Magnet Active: ", player_ship.is_magnet_active)
```

### **Known Issues to Monitor**

1. **SpaceCustomTheme.tres corruption** - UI styling may be affected
2. **Script syntax warnings** - Check console for any new errors
3. **Performance** - Visual effects should not cause frame drops

### **Success Criteria ‚úÖ**

- All 6 upgrade types purchase successfully
- Effects apply immediately and visibly
- Console logging confirms all operations
- No script errors during upgrade process
- Visual feedback provides clear user experience
- UI updates reflect upgrade changes in real-time

**The implementation is COMPLETE and ready for testing!**
