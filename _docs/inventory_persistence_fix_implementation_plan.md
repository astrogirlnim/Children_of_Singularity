# Game Data Persistence Fix - Implementation Checklist
**Children of the Singularity - Complete Backend Integration Phase**

## Overview
This checklist addresses game data persistence issues where player inventory, upgrades, credits, and progress reset upon game restart. The core issue is missing startup data loading functionality.

## Problem Summary
- ✅ **Saving**: All data saves correctly to database
- ❌ **Loading**: Game never loads existing data on startup
- **Result**: Players lose ALL progress when restarting the game

---

## **Phase 1: Critical Database Connection Fix** ⚡
**Priority**: Critical | **Timeline**: 1-2 days | **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

### 1.1 Player ID Format Standardization
**Files**: `PlayerShip3D.gd`, `PlayerShip.gd`, `APIClient.gd`

- [x] Verify UUID format in PlayerShip3D.gd (`"550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"`)
- [x] Verify UUID format in PlayerShip.gd (`"550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"`)
- [x] Add UUID validation function to APIClient.gd
- [x] Remove any remaining `"player_001"` fallback references

### 1.2 Database Connection Testing
- [x] Start backend server (`python backend/app.py`)
- [x] Test upgrade purchase endpoint with UUID format
- [x] Test inventory add/retrieve operations
- [x] Validate all API endpoints return 200 status codes
- [x] Verify no "invalid input syntax for type uuid" errors in logs

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] All API endpoints accept UUID player IDs
- [x] No UUID format errors in console
- [x] Database operations complete successfully

## **Phase 2: Complete Game Data Loading System** 🔄
**Priority**: High | **Timeline**: 2-3 days | **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

### 2.1 Zone Initialization Data Loading
**Files**: `ZoneMain3D.gd`, `ZoneMain.gd`

- [x] Add `_load_complete_player_data_from_backend()` method to ZoneMain3D.gd
- [x] Add `_load_complete_player_data_from_backend()` method to ZoneMain.gd (2D version)
- [x] Call loading function in `_initialize_3d_zone()` BEFORE other initialization
- [x] Connect API client signals for data reception
- [x] Implement loading state management with flags

**Implementation**:
```gdscript
func _initialize_3d_zone() -> void:
    # ... existing initialization ...

    # NEW: Load existing player data BEFORE applying defaults
    if api_client and player_ship:
        _load_complete_player_data_from_backend()

func _load_complete_player_data_from_backend() -> void:
    _log_message("Loading player data from backend...")

    # Connect signals for all data types
    api_client.player_data_loaded.connect(_on_player_data_loaded)
    api_client.inventory_updated.connect(_on_inventory_loaded)

    # Load all player data
    api_client.load_player_data(player_ship.player_id)  # Credits, upgrades, position
    api_client.load_inventory(player_ship.player_id)    # Inventory items
```

### 2.2 Player Data Reception and Application
**Files**: `ZoneMain3D.gd`, `ZoneMain.gd`

- [x] Add `_on_player_data_loaded(data: Dictionary)` handler
- [x] Process loaded credits and update player_ship.credits
- [x] Process loaded upgrades dictionary
- [x] Apply loaded upgrades using existing upgrade system
- [x] Restore upgrade effects (speed boosts, inventory capacity, etc.)
- [x] Update UI displays with loaded data immediately

**Implementation**:
```gdscript
func _on_player_data_loaded(data: Dictionary) -> void:
    _log_message("Applying loaded player data: %s" % data)

    if player_ship and data.has("credits"):
        player_ship.credits = data.credits
        _log_message("Restored credits: %d" % data.credits)

    if player_ship and data.has("upgrades"):
        # Apply each upgrade and its effects
        for upgrade_type in data.upgrades:
            var level = data.upgrades[upgrade_type]
            player_ship.upgrades[upgrade_type] = level

            # CRITICAL: Reapply upgrade effects
            if level > 0:
                player_ship._apply_upgrade_effects(upgrade_type, level)
                _log_message("Restored %s upgrade level %d with effects" % [upgrade_type, level])

    # Update UI immediately
    _update_credits_display()
    _populate_upgrade_catalog()  # Refresh to show loaded upgrades
```

### 2.3 Inventory Data Reception and Application
**Files**: `ZoneMain3D.gd`, `ZoneMain.gd`

- [x] Add `_on_inventory_loaded(inventory_data: Array)` handler
- [x] Convert inventory format from backend to game format
- [x] Restore inventory items to player ship
- [x] Update inventory UI with correct counts
- [x] Clear loading states when inventory is loaded

**Implementation**:
```gdscript
func _on_inventory_loaded(inventory_data: Array) -> void:
    _log_message("Applying loaded inventory: %d items" % inventory_data.size())

    if player_ship:
        player_ship.current_inventory.clear()
        player_ship.current_inventory = inventory_data.duplicate()

        _log_message("Restored inventory: %d/%d items" % [player_ship.current_inventory.size(), player_ship.inventory_capacity])

        # Update UI immediately
        _update_grouped_inventory_display(player_ship.current_inventory)
```

### 2.4 PlayerShip Initialization Order Fix
**Files**: `PlayerShip3D.gd`, `PlayerShip.gd`

- [x] Add `is_loading_from_backend: bool = false` flag to PlayerShip3D
- [x] Add `is_loading_from_backend: bool = false` flag to PlayerShip
- [x] Modify `_initialize_player_state()` to NOT clear data if loading
- [x] Set loading flag before data loading begins
- [x] Clear loading flag after data is applied
- [x] Ensure upgrade effects apply after loading

**Critical Fix**:
```gdscript
func _initialize_player_state() -> void:
    _log_message("PlayerShip3D: Initializing player state")

    # Don't clear data if we're loading from backend
    if not is_loading_from_backend:
        current_inventory.clear()
        credits = 0
        upgrades = {
            "speed_boost": 0,
            "inventory_expansion": 0,
            "collection_efficiency": 0,
            "zone_access": 1
        }
        _log_message("PlayerShip3D: Initialized with default values")
    else:
        _log_message("PlayerShip3D: Waiting for backend data load...")
```

### 2.5 Loading State Management
**Files**: `ZoneMain3D.gd`, `ZoneMain.gd`

- [x] Track loading progress for all data types (player data, inventory)
- [x] Handle loading completion when all data is received
- [x] Manage loading timeouts (30 second fallback)
- [x] Show loading UI during data retrieval
- [x] Hide loading UI when complete

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] Game loads existing inventory from database on startup
- [x] Player credits are restored correctly (275 credits successfully restored)
- [x] All purchased upgrades are restored with their effects active
- [x] Upgrade catalog shows correct levels ("Level 2/5" instead of "Level 0/5")
- [x] Ship speed, inventory capacity, and other upgrade effects work immediately (speed boosted from 150 to 300)
- [x] UI displays correct data immediately without requiring user action
