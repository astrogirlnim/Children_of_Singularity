# Phase 1: Setup (Barebones Framework) âœ… COMPLETE

## Scope
Establish the foundational project structure and environment. This phase delivers a minimally functional skeleton: the game can launch, basic folders and files exist, and the tech stack is validated, but no real gameplay is present.

## Deliverables âœ… ALL DELIVERED
- [x] Project launches in Godot with correct folder structure
- [x] Core directories and naming conventions in place
- [x] Version control and basic documentation initialized
- [x] Networking and backend stubs present (not functional)
- [x] Minimal placeholder scene loads (no gameplay)

---

## Features & Actionable Steps

### 1. Project Initialization
- [x] Create Godot 4.x project with correct name and settings
- [x] Set up version control (.git, .gitignore)
- [x] Add README with project overview
- [x] Validate Godot project launches on target platform

### 2. Directory & File Structure
- [x] Create `/scenes`, `/scenes/zones`, `/scenes/ui`, `/scripts`, `/assets`, `/audio/ai`, `/data/postgres`, `/logs`
- [x] Add placeholder files for key scenes/scripts (e.g., `ZoneMain.tscn`, `PlayerShip.gd`)
- [x] Ensure naming conventions match `project_rules.md`
- [x] Add .gdignore or placeholder files to keep empty dirs in git

### 3. Minimal Scene Setup
- [x] Create a root scene (e.g., `ZoneMain.tscn`) with a basic Node2D
- [x] Add a Camera2D and placeholder background
- [x] Add a placeholder Player node (no movement)
- [x] Confirm scene loads and displays in Godot

### 4. Networking & Backend Stubs
- [x] Add ENet networking stub (no real sync)
- [x] Add backend API stub (e.g., FastAPI/Flask project folder, no endpoints)
- [x] Add placeholder DB schema file (e.g., `schema.sql`)
- [x] Document tech stack choices in README

### 5. Basic Build/Test Pipeline
- [x] Add build/run instructions to README
- [x] Validate project can be opened and run by a new developer
- [x] Add initial log output (e.g., "Game started")

---

## Completion Criteria âœ… ALL COMPLETE
- [x] Project launches with correct structure
- [x] All core folders/files present and tracked
- [x] Minimal scene loads with no errors
- [x] Networking/backend stubs exist (not functional)
- [x] README and logs confirm setup

**ðŸŽ‰ PHASE 1 COMPLETE - All requirements satisfied and verified!**
