# Phase 1: Setup (Barebones Framework)

## Scope
Establish the foundational project structure and environment. This phase delivers a minimally functional skeleton: the game can launch, basic folders and files exist, and the tech stack is validated, but no real gameplay is present.

## Deliverables
- Project launches in Godot with correct folder structure
- Core directories and naming conventions in place
- Version control and basic documentation initialized
- Networking and backend stubs present (not functional)
- Minimal placeholder scene loads (no gameplay)

## Features & Actionable Steps

### 1. Project Initialization
- [ ] Create Godot 4.x project with correct name and settings
- [ ] Set up version control (.git, .gitignore)
- [ ] Add README with project overview
- [ ] Validate Godot project launches on target platform

### 2. Directory & File Structure
- [ ] Create `/scenes`, `/scenes/zones`, `/scenes/ui`, `/scripts`, `/assets`, `/audio/ai`, `/data/postgres`, `/logs`
- [ ] Add placeholder files for key scenes/scripts (e.g., `ZoneMain.tscn`, `PlayerShip.gd`)
- [ ] Ensure naming conventions match `project_rules.md`
- [ ] Add .gdignore or placeholder files to keep empty dirs in git

### 3. Minimal Scene Setup
- [ ] Create a root scene (e.g., `ZoneMain.tscn`) with a basic Node2D
- [ ] Add a Camera2D and placeholder background
- [ ] Add a placeholder Player node (no movement)
- [ ] Confirm scene loads and displays in Godot

### 4. Networking & Backend Stubs
- [ ] Add ENet networking stub (no real sync)
- [ ] Add backend API stub (e.g., FastAPI/Flask project folder, no endpoints)
- [ ] Add placeholder DB schema file (e.g., `schema.sql`)
- [ ] Document tech stack choices in README

### 5. Basic Build/Test Pipeline
- [ ] Add build/run instructions to README
- [ ] Validate project can be opened and run by a new developer
- [ ] Add initial log output (e.g., "Game started")

## Completion Criteria
- Project launches with correct structure
- All core folders/files present and tracked
- Minimal scene loads with no errors
- Networking/backend stubs exist (not functional)
- README and logs confirm setup
