# Phase 2: MVP (Minimal Viable Product)

## Scope
Deliver a playable, networked game with the core gameplay loop: explore, collect, trade, upgrade. The MVP is usable, fun, and demonstrates the projectâ€™s unique value, but lacks polish and advanced features.

## Deliverables
- Multiplayer zone with basic networking (ENet)
- Player can navigate, collect trash, and see inventory
- Trading at NPC hub for credits
- Simple upgrade system (speed, capacity, zone access)
- Static AI text messages at milestones
- Persistent player state (credits, inventory, upgrades)
- Minimal UI (HUD, inventory, trading, upgrade screens)

## Features & Actionable Steps

### 1. Multiplayer Zone (ENet)
- [ ] Implement server-authoritative ENet networking for a single shared zone
- [ ] Sync player positions and basic state
- [ ] Handle player join/leave events
- [ ] Add basic logging for network events

### 2. Player Navigation & Trash Collection
- [ ] Implement player movement controls (2D/2.5D)

- [ ] Track progression state per player
- [ ] Log upgrade purchases

### 5. AI Messaging (Static)
- [ ] Trigger static AI text messages at key milestones (first upgrade, sale, new zone)
- [ ] Display messages via UI overlay
- [ ] Log all AI message triggers

### 6. Minimal UI
- [ ] Implement HUD (inventory, credits, upgrade status)
- [ ] Add inventory and trading screens
