# Phase 2: MVP (Minimal Viable Product) - Simplified Local + Trading Architecture

## Scope
Deliver a playable game with the core gameplay loop: explore, collect, trade, upgrade. The simplified MVP uses **local storage for personal player data** and **AWS RDS only for player-to-player trading marketplace**, eliminating authentication complexity and reducing costs by 85%.

## Simplified Deliverables
- **Local player data management**: Credits, inventory, upgrades stored on player's computer
- **Trading marketplace**: Simple AWS RDS database for player-to-player exchanges
- Player can navigate, collect trash, and see inventory (fully local, no network lag)
- NPC trading for credits (local credit updates, no backend sync)
- Player-to-player trading of upgrades and debris (via trading marketplace)
- Simple upgrade system (speed, capacity, zone access) - locally stored
- Static AI text messages at milestones
- Persistent local player state with JSON file storage
- Minimal UI (HUD, inventory, trading, upgrade screens)

## ‚úÖ **Architecture Advantages**
- **85% cost reduction**: $12/month vs $80-130/month (overcomplicated approach)
- **Better performance**: No network lag for personal player actions
- **Offline capability**: Game works without internet connection
- **Privacy**: Personal data stays on player's computer
- **Faster development**: No authentication systems to build/test
- **Simpler debugging**: Local data easily inspected
